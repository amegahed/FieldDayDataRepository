	<p>By using alternative platforms like <%= application.name %>, you can take steps to take back control over your own data from the forces that currently monopolize and exploit our digital and online lives.  By using alternative web services or by hosting your own web services, you can have more control over you digital life as well as promote a healthier tech ecosystem. </p>

	<h2><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>Why Should You Care?</h2>
	<p>Why is it important to control your own data and software?  Why not just use the software and web services that are available from the tech giants? </p>  

	<p>The tools offered by the tech giants are convenient, they are often free, and they have billions of dollars of development resources behind them.  Why should you bother considering anything else?  If they get the job done, why should you even care?</p>

						<li>You want to have more choice in the software and web services that are available to you rather than just being satisfied with a handful of choices from the tech giants. </li>

						<li>You are concerned about the privacy and control of your own data and don't like the idea of being exploited for survelliance capitalism. </li>

						<li>You care about the ability to control and archive your data long into the future, regardless of corporate or policy changes that are outside of your control. </li>

						<li>You would like the option of being able to customize and tailor your personal tech to fit your individual needs or style instead of just using a one size fits all solution. </li>

						<li>You are a tech worker and you would like the option of being able to work for smaller, local employers rather than just a few large mega-corporations. </li>

	<p>A growing number of people are concerned about our freedom and believe that the current state of tech infrastructure is a threat. Here's what others are saying...</p>

		Today we face another software crisis, but it’s one we don’t talk about much. Only the largest, richest firms can afford to create connected applications. There is a cloud, but it’s proprietary. Our data and our knowledge is disappearing from our personal computers into clouds that we cannot access and with which we cannot compete. Who owns our social networks? It is like the mainframe-PC revolution in reverse.

		We used to control our computers. Now our computers are used to control us. As a handful of giant, essentially unaccountable corporations concentrated more and more resources and power in fewer and fewer places, the people surrendered an unprecedented degree of control over the flow of information and lost sovereignty over their technology.

		<h2><i class="fa fa-play"></i>What Can You Do? </h2>
		<p>If you care about any of these issues, then you should seriously consider looking into ways to opt out of the current tech giant controlled software and web services ecosystem. Fortunately, there are alternative options avaiable that are comparable and in many ways superior to than the solutions that everyone else uses.  It may take more effort to seek out these alternatives, but doing so provides benefits to you personally and also benefits to the world and community in which you live. </p>
