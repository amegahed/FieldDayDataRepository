On the Ice: Weather Station transports you to remote locations in Antarctica, where you are tasked with repairing a collection of weather stations. At each station, you’ll identify the components that are in disrepair, fix them in your mobile repair workshop, and then reinstall them. You’ll need to work quickly, though, to avoid getting stuck in a dangerous windstorm or left behind by your pilot. If you succeed, you’ll help restore a network of weather stations that are linked via satellites and used by researchers to understand and predict weather and climate patterns in Antarctica.
